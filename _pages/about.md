I am currently a Master student at Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Lijing Cheng](http://www.ocean.iap.ac.cn/pages/aboutUs/aboutUs.html?navAnchor=aboutUs) My research focuses on understanding understanding the oceanâ€™s role in a changing climate based on observation. My interests are wide-ranging and include, but are not limited to: 
1) the Earth's energy flow and water cycle,
2) Contemporary sea level budget,
3) Atlantic meridional heat and freshwater transport.
