I am currently a Master student at [Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](www.iap.cas.cn), working with [Prof. Lijing Cheng](http://www.ocean.iap.ac.cn/pages/aboutUs/aboutUs.html?navAnchor=aboutUs)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
